<!-- This sends a POST request, gets routed to the 'create' action in RelationshipsController. It doesn't have any content
but we still need to send the followed_id, so we do that with the f.hidden_field -->

<!-- How does this know to go to relationships controller? I think it's because it's form_for (a_relationship) so
	 it automatically routes it -->
